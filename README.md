\## ISAAC: Intervention-based Structural Auditing



This repository contains the code and notebooks used to produce the results

reported in the paper \*\*ISAAC: Intervention-Based Structural Auditing of Deep

Models for Transcription Factor Binding\*\*.



The experiments use transcription factor binding prediction as a biological

case study.



\### Contents

\- Data preparation and PWM construction

\- Model training procedure (documented for reproducibility)

\- Robust ISAAC audit with label-balanced bootstrap

\- Generation of paper-ready tables and figures



\### Execution

Run the notebooks in order:

1\. `0-isaac-load.ipynb` — data preparation and structural prior construction  

2\. `1-isaac-train.ipynb` — training procedure used in the paper (documented)  

3\. `2-isaac-audit.ipynb` — ISAAC audit and result generation  



\### Reproducibility

\- Fixed random seeds throughout

\- Audits performed on frozen model checkpoints

\- Raw intervention effects (ΔS) are saved to disk

\- All reported results, tables, and figures are generated by the notebooks
